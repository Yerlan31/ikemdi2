# Tournaments Website

This project aims to create an online tournament system where users can register, log in, and conduct tournaments. Organizers can set the time and place of the tournament, limits on the number of participants, sponsor logos, and edit tournament information. Competitors can apply to participate and enter the results of their encounters.

## Usage

To run this project, ensure you have Node.js installed along with all the libraries mentioned at the beginning of the app.js file, with an addition of the EJS module. Additionally, use the datasetCreator.js prior to running app.js as the application needs access to a database. DatasetCreator creates a local database using PostgreSQL, thus requiring an installation of PostgreSQL on the machine. The database in the code uses 'postgres' user with 'admin' password and localhost port = 5432, and database name = 'postgres'.

To run app.js, use the command:

        node app.js

To run datasetCreator.js, use the command:

        node datasetCreator.js

Note that the entire website operates solely on your local machine, so any emails sent by the system (e.g., for account confirmation) will be available in the terminal as a link to the local email website.

If you do not wish to install all these requirements, you can watch a demo presented below:
